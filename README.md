# About 
I am a data science enthusiast originally from Sinaloa, Mexico. My background lies in physics, where I earned both a bachelor's and master's degree. After discovering my passion for data science, I embarked on a journey of self-directed learning to develop my skills in this field. This led to a valuable opportunity in the credit department, where I spent a year working on data analysis and modeling.

Recently, I relocated to Massachusetts with my family and am now seeking new opportunities to leverage my data science skills and continue my learning journey. I'm eager to collaborate with a team and contribute to impactful projects.
